# To-Do List with localStorage and TypeScript

## Overview
In this simple project I built a To-Do app using both TypeScript and localStorage. There were some challenges using TypeScript and the configuration file so I took the Mastering TypeScript course from Colt Steele to help me with some concepts. 

## Features
The main purpose is to add some items to the list and check them so they can be deleted after.

## Running the project:
This project is live on the following link: [https://benevolent-bienenstitch-0d652b.netlify.app/].
Alternatively, you can just download the files, `cd into your project directory`, then run `npm install` to install the dependencies and finally `npm start`.

`tsc -w index.ts` will allow to recompile the code everytime we save the TypeScript file.
